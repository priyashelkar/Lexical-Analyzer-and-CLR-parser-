# Lexical-Analyzer-and-CLR-parser-
A Lexical Analyzer that tokenizes source code into tokens and a Canonical LR (CLR) Parser that performs syntax analysis using LR(1) parsing tables. This project covers key compiler design concepts like tokenization, parsing table generation, and error detection during parsing.
